              <p>
                I am 18 years old, and 
                I recently graduated from the Ohio State University College of
                Engineering's Full-Stack Web Development Program in early January
                2023.  I'm looking for new opportunities to continue to grow my 
                skillset!

                The main goal of my recent Ohio State University Coding Boot 
                Camp was to learn AND become comfortable with React.  I have 
                accomplished this goal, as I understand the concepts of 
                Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), Model-View-Controller (MVC), 
                and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) very well.  Understanding 
                these programming languages greatly helps me when building a 
                myriad of applications using React framework.

              <h1>ü§ùTeamwork</h1>
              <p>
                I have always thrived when working in a team-oriented 
                environment, whether it was during the many group school 
                assignments or in my current employment at ALDI.  I truly 
                believe great teamwork is paramount to achieving success in 
                any project.

              <h1>üß†Troubleshooting</h1>
              <p>
              I have a constant will to adapt to any given situation or 
              problem that arises, development related, or not.  I am always 
              eager to step out of my comfort zone to grow as an individual 
              or learn something new.
